# PROPTECH TRIAL: SAN FRANCISCO RENTAL MARKET

In pursuit of a full rollout of the one-click buy/rent investment platform, I have simulated the Proptech feature using San Francisco as the real-estate market. This feature not only analyzes various real estate metrics by neighborhood, it also visualizes the outputs in stunning, interactive detail. This will be achieved by completing the following:

1. Calculate and plot the housing units per year.

2. Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot. 

3. Compare the average prices by neighborhood.

4. Build an interactive neighborhood map using the powerful GeoView technology.

5. Determine the viability of this platform based on the data provided.

The ultimate goal of this state of the art prototype application is to display, demonstrate and determine potential real-estate investment opportunities using the San Francisco housing market from 2010-2016 as a point of reference, and to test the viability of the one-click feature is ready for immediate implementation.


## TECHNOLOGIES

In order for this immersive application to run, there are installation requirements. They are the following:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Python programming language.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Access to the web-based IDE JupyterLab.  

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Grants access to the open-source Pandas data analysis tool, which is powered by Python.

[HVPLOT](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - Enables the user to implement and use the interactive hvplot system to view and map data values.

[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) - Enables the user to read compiled San Francisco real-estate data.


## USAGE

In order to execute, plot, and simulate this code, you must run the following:

```python
